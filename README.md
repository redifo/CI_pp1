## Design

### Colour Scheme

In my css file I have used variables to declare colours, and then used these throughout the css file. I was recently introduced to this method during a hackathon - it is a useful convention to use as it allows you to alter the colour throughout the website if you decide to update a colour, by changing the colour once in the variable.

* I have used `#f5f5f5` & `#000000` as the primary and secondary colours used for the sites text.
* I have used `#292929` as the overlay used over the sites background image.
* I have used `#a50c3c` for the border of the modal and to display the wrong answers.
* I have used `#047638` to display the correct answer.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.


![ Font Example]()

* For the body of the page I have used the google font . QuickSand is a sans-serif font which has lovely clean lines. I have chosen to use a sans-serif font for the body of the page as studies have found that sans-serif fonts are generally more legible to read on a screen.

![ Font Example](documentation/)

### Imagery

As the website is called The Quiz Arms, I wanted to use an image for the page background of a pub to give the user the feeling that they are participating in a pub quiz.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop using balsamiq.

### Features

The website is comprised of a home page, page.

All Pages on the website are responsive and have:

* A favicon in the browser tab.

  ![favicon](documentation/p)

* The title of the site at the top of every page. This title also acts as a link back to the home page.
  ![   Title](documentation/)

#### The Home Page

The home page  sites name as a title and then a container which holds some welcome text, 

![Home page image](documentation/features/)

#### The Categories Page

The game page displays the sites name as a title. This also acts as a link back to the home page.

#### Future Implementations

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using a hover state on all buttons on the site to make it clear to the user if they are hovering over a button.
* Choosing a sans serif font for the site - these fonts are suitable for people with dyslexia.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.

In a future implementation I think it would be a great accessibility feature to also add a symbol such as a tick or cross on the answer button to enable people who are colour blind to also be able to access the quiz easier. Each of the images below have whether they are correct/incorrect in the name. Can you tell which one is which?
