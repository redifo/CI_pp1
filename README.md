## Design

### Colour Scheme



  ![ Color Scheme](documentation/color-scheme.webp)

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.


![ Font Example]()

* For the body of the page I have used the google font Work sans. Work Sans provides a modern and clean aesthetic with its sans-serif style. Sans-serif fonts are often chosen for their contemporary look and improved readability on digital screens. For the long texts on life hack boxes i have used Merriweather (Serif). It has small lines or strokes at the ends of characters which aid in guiding the reader's eye along the text.

![ Font Example](documentation/)

### Imagery

The imagery was designed to blend into the color scheme by Dall-e 3 using the following prompts:

* For life hack box images: (life hack text same as used in the website) + cartoon illustration of the Life Hack given above use a background color of  #05386f double check the backgroud color.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile using balsamiq.

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using a hover state on all buttons on the site to make it clear to the user if they are hovering over a button.
* Choosing a sans serif font for the site - these fonts are known to be easy to read.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
